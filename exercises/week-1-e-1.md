# Week 1 Exercise: AI-Assisted "Hello World"

## Overview
This introductory exercise will help you become familiar with using AI tools for coding assistance. You'll implement a simple program in a language of your choice, but with a twist - you'll use AI to help write parts of it.

## Objectives
- Set up and test your development environment
- Experience AI-assisted coding with GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT
- Write a simple program with AI assistance
- Document your experience with AI tools

## Exercise Instructions

### Part 1: Choose a Programming Language
- Select a programming language you're comfortable with (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)
- **Challenge option**: Choose a language you're not familiar with!

### Part 2: Create a New Project
1. Open VS Code
2. Create a new folder for this exercise
3. Initialize a Git repository in this folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
4. Create a new file for your program (e.g., `hello_world.py`, `hello_world.js`, etc.)

### Part 3: Use AI Assistance to Write Your Program
You'll create a "Hello World" program with these requirements:
- Print "Hello, World!" to the console
- Ask for the user's name and store it
- Greet the user by name
- Print the current date and time
- Have at least one function or method
- Include proper error handling (e.g., for input)
- Add appropriate comments

**Using GitHub Copilot:**
1. Enable GitHub Copilot in VS Code
2. Start by writing comments describing what you want to do
3. Let Copilot suggest code implementations
4. Accept, modify, or reject suggestions as needed

**Using ChatGPT (alternative):**
1. Go to chat.openai.com
2. Ask ChatGPT to help you write a program with the requirements listed above
3. Copy and refine the code in your file

### Part 4: Test Your Program
1. Run your program to ensure it works as expected
2. Fix any issues that arise

### Part 5: Document Your Experience
Create a `README.md` file in your project folder and write about:
1. What language you chose and why
2. How you used the AI tool (what prompts or methods worked best)
3. What suggestions from the AI were helpful
4. What suggestions you had to modify or correct
5. What you learned about AI-assisted coding from this exercise

Sample README template:
```markdown
# AI-Assisted Hello World

## Language Choice
I chose [language] because [reason].

## AI Tool Used
I used [GitHub Copilot/ChatGPT] to assist with coding.

## The AI Experience
Here's how I used the AI tool and what I discovered:

- **What worked well:**
  - [Example 1]
  - [Example 2]

- **What didn't work well:**
  - [Example 1]
  - [Example 2]

- **Modifications I made:**
  - [Example 1]
  - [Example 2]

## What I Learned
[2-3 paragraphs about your experience and what you learned]

## Screenshot
[Include a screenshot of your code and program output]
```

### Part 6: Commit Your Work
1. Add your files to Git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Complete Week 1 AI-assisted Hello World exercise"
   ```
3. If we've set up a class repository, push your work following the instructor's directions

## Submission
- Upload your code file and README.md to the course submission system
- Be prepared to share your experience briefly in the next class
